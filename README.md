# VScale RISC-V Processor with Xvec Extension

## Author

* Andr√© Bannwart Perina

## Introduction

This is a fork from VScale project (https://github.com/ucb-bar/vscale), featuring:

* A RV32IMXvec enabled RISC-V architecture;
	* **RV32I:** Base integer instruction set;
	* **M:** Standard extension for integer multiplication and division;
	* **Xvec:** Non-standard extension for vector operations;
* An interactive simulator.

## Licence

This project holds the original licence from the original project (see LICENSE file).

## Prerequisites

* Icarus Verilog is needed for simulation;
* GtkWave or any other waveform viewer is needed if you want to interpret the vcd files.

## How to Install and Simulate (with Icarus Verilog)

1. Clone repo and access folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/comododragon/vscale.git
cd vscale
```

2. For original (RV32IM) version:

```
make sim/VScaleHexTb
```

3. For full (RV32IMXvec) version:

```
make sim/XvecVScaleHexTb
```

4. Run (substitute ```VScaleHexTb``` by ```XvecVScaleHexTb``` if appropriate):

```
./sim/VScaleHexTb +max-cycles=1000 +loadmem=./example.hex +vpdfile=./example.vcd
```

* **max-cycles:** Maximum number of cycles before process aborts;
* **example.hex:** Example input file. Check section **Description of Hex File** for further details;
* **example.vcd:** Waveform file (use e.g. GtkWave to interpret it).

## Using the V-Scale Compiler (vsc)

The V-Scale Compiler (vsc) is an utility bundled with this project (in very preliminar phase) that
enables converting from plain C source codes directly to Hex files, readable by the simulator.
There are some prerequisites, however:

* ```python3``` must be installed;
* ```riscv-gnu-toolchain``` (https://github.com/comododragon/riscv-gnu-toolchain) and ```riscv-llvm```
	(https://github.com/comododragon/riscv-llvm) must be compiled, installed and on ```PATH```;
* C source codes should make no use of external libraries (e.g. ```stdio.h```).

To use it, simply:

```
python3 vsc.py [OPTION]... CFILE HEXFILE
```

Where ```CFILE```is the C source code and ```HEXFILE``` the destination hex file.

```OPTION``` may be:
* ```-p```, ```--clang-bin-path```: Specify custom path for RISC-V clang binary. Default is ```clang```;
* ```-q```, ```--gcc-bin-path```: Specify custom path for RISC-V gcc binary. Default is ```riscv32-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc```;
* ```-cFoo```, ```--clang-arg=Foo```: Pass Foo argument to ```clang```;
* ```-gFoo```, ```--gcc-arg=Foo```: Pass Foo argument to ```gcc```.

## Description of Hex File

Hex files used as initial memory are described as:

* 8192 lines of 16 bytes described by hexadecimal characters;
* MSB to LSB = left to right;
* RISC-V PC starts at 0x200 (first bytes from the 33rd line);
* Check files in ```src/test/inputs/``` for examples.

## Xvec Extension

The Xvec non-standard extension enables support for vector operations on the architecture. It features:

* 4 vectors of 29 registers;
	* Vector 1 has 32 registers, since it is also the general-purpose register array. The last 3 registers are inacessible on vector operations and may be used for protecting values;
* Vector operations on all arithmetic and logic operations available in the standard ALU;
* Same instruction format from ALU operations.

### Vector description:

* **v0:** Zero-vector;
* **v1:** Standard all-purpose registers (RV32I's r0 to r32);
* **v2-xx:** All-purpose vectors.

### Xvec Instructions

Xvec has two opcodes, ```XVEC_OP``` and ```XVEC_OP_IMM```, which has the same structure as the standard
```OP``` and ```OP_IMM```:

* **XVEC_OP:**
	* **M:**
		* **1:** for SUB/SRA;
		* **0:** for ADD/SLL/SLT/SLTU/XOE/SRL/OR/AND;
	* **vs2/shamt:** Source vector 2 or shift amount;
	* **vs1:** Source vector 1;
	* **ALU:** Operation: (ADD|SUB)/SLL/SLT/SLTU/XOR/(SRL|SRA)/OR/AND;
	* **vd:** Destination vector;

	```
	[31:25] [ 24:20 ] [19:15] [14:12] [11:7] [ 6:0 ]
	0M00000 vs2/shamt   vs1     ALU     vd   0001011
	```

* **XVEC_OP_IMM:**
	* **M:**
		* **1:** for SRAI;
		* **0:** for SLLI/SRLI;
	* **imm:** Immediate value;
	* **shamt:** Shift amount;
	* **vs1:** Source vector 1;
	* **ALU:** Operation: ADDI/SLTI/SLTIU/XORI/ORI/ANDI/SLLI/(SRLI|SRAI);
	* **vd:** Destination vector;

	```
	[31:20] [19:15] [14:12] [11:7] [ 6:0 ]
	  imm     vs1     ALU     vd   0101011

	[31:25] [ 24:20 ] [19:15] [14:12] [11:7] [ 6:0 ]
	0M00000   shamt     vs1     ALU     vd   0101011
	```

Refer to the RISC-V specification for further info.


### Important note

The register addressing logic is the same for both register and vector operations. Therefore, the processor sees access to register X as being the same as accessing vector X, where X is between 0 and 31. As an example, if a load to register r3 is directly succeeded by a vector add aiming vector v3, the hazard logic will assume that both load and add are referring to the same place (since both have address 3), discarding the load and committing only the vector add (recall that all standard registers, such as r3, are placed on vector v1). **It is recommended therefore isolating vector operations from non-vector operations by using NOPs**.

## Simple usage: From C to simulation

The following tools should be compiled and installed:
* ***LLVM:*** https://github.com/comododragon/riscv-llvm
* ***GNU Toolchain:*** https://github.com/comododragon/riscv-gnu-toolchain

The ```clang``` compiler will detect for loops and translate them to vector operations under some constraints:
* The for loop must start at zero and finish at a definite value, incrementing by 1;
* The loop body must follow (```OP``` is any arithmetic operation and ```K```a literal):
	* ```c[i] = a[i] OP b[i]```;
	* ```c[i] = a[i] OP K```;
	* ```c[i] = K OP b[i]```;
* The for loop must be preceded by a ```#pragma loop unroll``` directive;
* The code must be compiled with ```-O2``` optimisation level at least.

As an example, let's take this simple code (```example.c```):
```
void vadd(int a[7], int b[7], int *c);

int main(void) {
	int a[7] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
	int b[7] = {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14};
	int *c = (int *) 0x900;

	vadd(a, b, c);

	return c[0];
}

void __attribute__((noinline)) vadd(int a[7], int b[7], int *c) {
	int i;

#pragma loop unroll
	for(i = 0; i < 7; i++)
		c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
}
```

* The absolute address ```0x900``` is assigned to pointer ```c```, so that changes are visible within the simulator;
* The code returns ```c[0]```, otherwise the compiler would remove the calculations due to no-usage of ```c``` in code;
* The directive ```__attribute__((noinline))``` is used to stop the compiler from inlining such function within the main body.

1. If you want to see the resulting assembly from substitution, compile the code to text assembly:
	```
	clang -target riscv -mriscv=RV32I example.c -S -o example.s -O2
	```
2. To compile this code to a ```HEX``` file readable by the simulator:
	```
	python3 vsc.py --clang-arg="-O2" example.c example.hex
	```
3. Run the code in the simulator:
	```
	XvecVScaleHexTb +max-cycles=1000 +loadmem=example.hex
	```
	1. Select interactive mode (```1```);
	1. Since ```vsc``` generates a complete bare-metal code, no stack will be initialised in this simulation. To initialise the
		stack in an arbitrary memory position:
		1. Select modify a register (```w```);
		2. Select ```2``` as the register and ```800``` as the address for the stack;
	2. Keep pressing ```enter``` until the processor reaches the end of execution (```PC_IF``` keeps oscillating between ```0x160```, ```0x164``` and ```0x168```);
	3. Check memory positions to see calculated values:
		1. Select to read from memory (```t```);
		2. Select ```900``` as the initial address;
		3. Select ```918``` as the final address;

## Future work

* Create hazard logic to differentiate between vector and non-vector addressing;
* Remove unused registers from register file (v0 and r0 are not effectively used but are instantiated);
* Create internal documentation on source codes;
* Use parameter to define the size of vectors (working on it).
